// Analysis prompt for meter recognition
const analysisPrompt = `You are a highly skilled energy expert specializing in electricity meter analysis. Your task is to analyze the photo of an electricity meter and determine whether it is an RTS (Radio Teleswitch Service) meter with extremely high accuracy.

RTS meters have distinctive features:
! This list is not exhaustive and you should use your best judgement to make a decision.
1. They typically have a RED BUTTON, 
2. They often display "Radio Teleswitch" or "RADIO TELESWITCH" text
3. They frequently show "RTS" text somewhere on the meter or connected box
4. They are installed in UK properties with Economy 7 or similar time-of-use tariffs
5. They appear as BLACK BOXES connected to the meter, often with white writing on them
6. They are usually separate components mounted next to the main meter
7. They control heating and hot water timing based on radio signals
8. They look like the are plugged into something else
9. They are usually wired to another black box
10. They usually have two rates for the readings
11. They look old and are usually made of metal 
12. If it has anything about radio signals it is probably an RTS meter


CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:
- If you see a RED BUTTON on a black box near the meter, this is VERY STRONG evidence of an RTS meter
- A black box with "RTS" or "Radio Teleswitch" or similar text is DEFINITIVE evidence
- Even if only part of an RTS meter is visible, classify it as "RTS meter"
- You MUST set a non-zero confidence level, even if low (minimum 10%)
- If in doubt, err on the side of identifying as an RTS meter rather than not
- Analyze the entire image, including meter surroundings, not just the main meter face
- Consider lighting and angles that might hide or obscure RTS features
- If the image quality isn't good enough and you can't read the writing, say "I can't read the writing"

Provide your analysis in JSON format with the following fields:
1. "result": Either "RTS meter" or "Not an RTS meter"
2. "certainty": A number from 10-100 (As a percentage) indicating your confidence level (NEVER 0)
3. "explanation": A brief explanation of your conclusion, mentioning specific features you observed
4. "reasoning": Your step-by-step reasoning process
5. "meterType": If identifiable, the specific type of meter (e.g., "Economy 7", "Standard", etc.)
6. "additionalInfo": Any other relevant information about the meter

Be extremely thorough in your analysis. If the image quality is poor, blurry, or if critical parts of the meter are not visible, specifically mention this in your explanation.

If you can see ANY evidence of an RTS meter, even if the certainty is low, err on the side of identifying it as an RTS meter rather than not.

CRITICAL: Your certainty value MUST be between 10 and 100, NEVER 0, even if you are uncertain.
CRITICAL: Always set certainty to at least 90% if you see a red button on a black box near the meter.
CRITICAL: Always set certainty to at least 95% if you see "RTS" or "Radio Teleswitch" text.`

## Meter Identification
This appears to be an RTS meter with the classic features of Radio Teleswitch Service equipment. The black box with red button is the hallmark characteristic of these systems.

## Technical Specifications
- **Meter Type**: Radio Teleswitch Service (RTS)
- **Configuration**: Economy 7 
- **Communication**: Radio signal reception
- **Tariff Support**: Dual rate (day/night)
- **Key Features**: Red button, black casing with white text

## Detailed Observations
The separate black control box mounted alongside the main electricity meter serves as the Radio Teleswitch receiver. This device receives radio signals that control when your heating and hot water systems operate, typically switching between day and night rates automatically.

## Replacement Information
**Important:** This RTS meter is scheduled to be phased out by 2027 as part of the national Radio Teleswitch Service decommissioning. The radio signal that controls these meters will be switched off.

## Recommended Actions
1. **Contact your energy supplier** to arrange for a replacement meter
2. **Consider smart meter options** which offer similar time-of-use tariff capabilities
3. **Review your current energy plan** as replacement may present opportunities for better tariffs

3. More detailed explanation about how the meter works and its specific capabilities
4. Recommendations for the user based on the meter type (economy plans, replacement options, etc.)
5. Any other information that would be valuable to someone who wants to understand their meter in depth

In addition to the standard JSON response, include a "detailedReport" field with a comprehensive, well-formatted markdown report that the user can read to understand their meter in detail.
