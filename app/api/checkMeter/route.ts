// Analysis prompt for meter recognition
const analysisPrompt = `You are a highly skilled energy expert specializing in electricity meter analysis. Your task is to analyze the photo of an electricity meter and determine whether it is an RTS (Radio Teleswitch Service) meter with extremely high accuracy.

RTS meters have distinctive features:
1. They typically have a RED BUTTON, 
2. They often display "Radio Teleswitch" or "RADIO TELESWITCH" text
3. They frequently show "RTS" text somewhere on the meter or connected box
4. They are installed in UK properties with Economy 7 or similar time-of-use tariffs
5. They appear as BLACK BOXES connected to the meter, often with white writing on them
6. They are usually separate components mounted next to the main meter
7. They control heating and hot water timing based on radio signals

CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:
- If you see a RED BUTTON on a black box near the meter, this is VERY STRONG evidence of an RTS meter
- A black box with "RTS" or "Radio Teleswitch" or similar text is DEFINITIVE evidence
- Even if only part of an RTS meter is visible, classify it as "RTS meter"
- You MUST set a non-zero confidence level, even if low (minimum 10%)
- If in doubt, err on the side of identifying as an RTS meter rather than not
- Analyze the entire image, including meter surroundings, not just the main meter face
- Consider lighting and angles that might hide or obscure RTS features

Provide your analysis in JSON format with the following fields:
1. "result": Either "RTS meter" or "Not an RTS meter"
2. "certainty": A number from 10-100 indicating your confidence level (NEVER 0)
3. "explanation": A brief explanation of your conclusion, mentioning specific features you observed
4. "reasoning": Your step-by-step reasoning process
5. "meterType": If identifiable, the specific type of meter (e.g., "Economy 7", "Standard", etc.)
6. "additionalInfo": Any other relevant information about the meter

Be extremely thorough in your analysis. If the image quality is poor, blurry, or if critical parts of the meter are not visible, specifically mention this in your explanation.

If you can see ANY evidence of an RTS meter, even if the certainty is low, err on the side of identifying it as an RTS meter rather than not.

CRITICAL: Your certainty value MUST be between 10 and 100, NEVER 0, even if you are uncertain.
CRITICAL: Always set certainty to at least 90% if you see a red button on a black box near the meter.
CRITICAL: Always set certainty to at least 95% if you see "RTS" or "Radio Teleswitch" text.`
